To easily test the code open Pycharm and start a new project. Drag the q4.py and image files into the main directory.
At the bottom of the Q4.py file you can chose which steps to run by commenting out the step1(),step2() .. functions. 
After running the file you will have the images for each step you chose to run inside the same directory.
